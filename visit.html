        <h4>High Tatras</h4>

        </a>
        <p class="tatry-winter">The High Tatras and Low Tatras are great
            for spending active holidays during the whole year because they offer numerous ski, hiking and
            mountaineering opportunities.Slovakia's karst areas offer an high number of caves. Thirteen caves are open
            to the public. Ochtinská Aragonite Cave is one of three aragonite caves in the world, but probably the most
            famous caves are Dobšinská ice cave and Demänovská dripstone cave. Tatras are rightly often referred to as
            “miniature Alps” because on a small area of 341 square kilometres (260 square kilometres on the Slovak side
            of the border with Poland) they offer the same as the Alps except for glaciers. Lovers of alpine hiking
            visit valleys of the mountain range or climb to its peaks (Kriváň, Rysy, Gerlachovský štít peak with
            mountain guide).
        <p class="tatry-winter">
            Winter is the synonym of skiing. The best ski tracks are available at Areál snov in the commune Štrbské
            pleso and at Skalnaté pleso above the commune Tatranská Lomnica where the ski season lasts until mid-May.
            The Tatras also have several climatic spas.</p>

        <section class="Orava-top">
            <h4>Orava</h4>

            </a>
            <p class="orava">The region of Orava lies in the north-western part of Slovakia, on the border with the
                Poland.
                The border crossing in environs of the village Oravská Polhora is also the northernmost point of
                Slovakia.
                The axis of the region is the Orava river.</p>
            <p class="orava">Region possesses almost everything a tourist may wish. The mountains ranges Malá Fatra,
                Chočské
                vrchy and above all Západné Tatry - Roháče are the paradise for hikers, cyclists and visitors. Lovers of
                hiking like to climb the Roháče Mts. and to the passes over the west Tatra ridge. Walks in environs of
                Oravice or ascents to the Babia hora or Veľký Choč peaks are also among the favourites.</p>
            <p class="orava">Winter months in Orava are equally charming. Down-hill skiing in Zuberec and its environs
                including Kubínska hoľa or cross-country ski tracks through the Skorušinské vrchy and Oravská Magura
                mountains provide an unforgettable experience to skiers of Slovakia and from abroad. Orava also has
                architectural monuments in every commune. The most valuable of them is the Castle of Orava towering
                above
                the eponymous river.</p>

            <p class="bojnice">The gem of Bojnice is the ”fairy-tale” Bojnický zámok Castle, one of the most visited and
                most beautiful castles not only in Slovakia, but also in central Europe</p>
            <p class="bojnice">The Castle stands on a large travertine monticule on the site of medieval castle from the
                11th century. In the past, the most famous Hungarian noble families owned it and the last of them was
                the
                family of Pálfi. Count Ján Pálfi had the structure reconstructed by the architect J. Hubert from
                Budapest at
                the end of the 19th century following the pattern of romantic castles of the Loire in central France.
                The
                typical silhouette of the romantic image of medieval castle is enhanced by steep roofs of the palace,
                chapel
                and towers.</p>
            <p class="bojnice">Collections of artistic and historical museum are concentrated in the interior of the
                castle.
                Among them is the original furniture and the artistic collection of the Pálffys from the turn of the
                19th
                and 20th centuries and the most valuable item of national importance is the Late-Gothic altar of Bojnice
                made by Nardo di Cione Ortagna, artist from Florence in the mid-14th century. The visit to the castle
                includes that of dripstone cave under the Castle that communicates with the 26-m deep castle well. </p>
            <p class="bojnice">nternational Festival of Ghosts and Spooks in held here regularly by the end of April and
                beginning of May. It is when the Bojnický zámok Castle becomes the meeting point of ghosts, spooks,
                witches,
                and vampires from all over the world. </p>
            <p class="bojnice">An extensive park and landscape park are the inseparable parts of the castle area. The
                600-year old lime tree of Bojnice of the King Matthias with 12.5-m trunk circumference stands in front
                the
                castle entrance.</p>

                    north-west of Slovakia, only several kilometres from Žilina.
                    Interesting landforms in form of rock towers, needles, windows and gates separated by deep
                    waterless
                    gorges, ravines and valleys are the results of action of rain, ice, and wind, in other words –
                    chemical and mechanical weathering.</p>
                <p class="sulov-text"> Among the most beautiful forms here are the 13 metres tall Gotická brána
                    (the
                    Gothic Gate), a rock mushroom and many other rocks with fancy names (for instance, Maria
                    Theresa,
                    Owl, Spruce Tree and the like). The 7.5 kilometres long instructive path in form of circle has
                    17
                    stops.Visitors can also admire the richest site of orchids in Slovakia, the Súľovský vodopád

                        with colorfully restored facades, lively outdoor cafés, and swanky boutiques. Its ramshackle
                        industrial quarter, just east of the center, is rapidly being redeveloped into a forest of
                        skyscrapers. The hilltop castle gleams.It's arguably the fastest-changing city in Europe.

                        a worker
                        who seems to be resting at the exit of a shaft (called Cumil). On the main square there is a
                        statue
                        of a Napoleon soldier or on Hviezdoslav Square one of Hans Christen Andersen, the famous

                        storyteller. Bratislava Castle which you must-see in the city, you can't miss it! Wherever
                        you go in
                        Bratislava, you can almost always see it. Perched on a small hill, the castle overlooks the
                        city and
                        the Danube. </p>
